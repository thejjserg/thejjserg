- 👋 Hi, I’m @thejjserg
I graduated from the University of Michigan - Dearborn, where I studied Applied Statistics and earned a minor in Economics and English. After I graduated, I worked as a Product Owner on an Infrastructure Systems Team at Rocket Central's Data Inteligence. I learned the project management side of the business via Agile methodologies, and, in that time, I earned a certification in Product Ownership and Scrum Master. I have since moved on from project management, and I am in pursuit of a career change to Data Science. I am currently learning Python on Codecademy. Check out my projects in my public repositories! Let me know if you would like to collaborate on a project! I love working with others and continuosly learning!

  
- 👀 I’m interested in games, basketball, and social media!
  My favorite games are Catan, Yu-Gi-Oh Goat and Edison formats, and Marvel Champions!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL, and Git on Codecademy. I'm on the Data Science career track!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science projects!
- 📫 How to reach me? Send me a DM or email!
